Players with MNG injuries are excluded from the stats for the match they miss - the replay files have no info about them so it is impossible to disaply them without parsing the other replay files to find the match in which they got injured. This would be impossible for the other coach anyway unless both matches were against the same coach.

Assistant Coach numbers are not recorded in the XML? can it reliably be calculated from TV?
